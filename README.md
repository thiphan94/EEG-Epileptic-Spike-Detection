# EEG Epileptic Spike Detection Project

## Overview

Epileptic spike detection in EEG data is a significant challenge in both data science and neural science. The primary objective of this project is to develop an algorithm capable of automatically detecting whether a given instance, such as an EEG data series, contains an epileptic spike or not. This task is pivotal for accurate diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. The project addresses two key challenges:

1. **Class Imbalance:** Epileptic spike behaviors are minority instances when compared to normal behaviors in EEG data.
2. **Interpatient Variability:** The morphologies of epileptic spikes vary considerably across different patients.

The scope of this project focuses on the analysis of multi-channel EEG data series. The provided datasets stem from two distinct experiments and have undergone preprocessing to ensure consistency.

## Dataset

The dataset employed in this project is composed of multiple multivariate data series, each maintaining a consistent frequency. These data series originate from two separate experiments and have been divided into fixed-length subsequences. Each subsequence includes five channels, with each channel containing 768 sample points, temporally aligned.

The data series are labeled as follows:

- **Positive Instances (Label 1):** These instances represent EEG data segments containing epileptic spikes. The occurrence of a spike is indicated by a vertical line in the corresponding plot.
- **Negative Instances (Label 0):** These instances encompass normal EEG data series.

The visual depiction of the two types of data series is shown in Figure 1, with the positive example featuring a marked vertical line representing the timing of the epileptic spike.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, preprocess, and segment the raw EEG data series into fixed-length subsequences, ensuring alignment across channels.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from each subsequence to capture distinctive patterns in both normal and epileptic spike instances.

3. **Model Selection:** Explore various machine learning and neural network models suitable for imbalanced data classification tasks.

4. **Model Training:** Train and validate the selected models using appropriate techniques such as cross-validation to handle class imbalance effectively.

5. **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluate the models using relevant metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) to gauge their effectiveness in spike detection.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the chosen models to optimize performance.

7. **Interpatient Variability Handling:** Investigate techniques to handle the variability in spike morphologies across different patients.

8. **Results and Discussion:** Present the achieved results, including model performance and insights into handling challenges posed by class imbalance and interpatient variability.

## Conclusion

Epileptic spike detection in EEG data holds crucial implications for both medical diagnosis and research. By addressing the challenges of class imbalance and interpatient variability, this project aims to contribute to the development of accurate and robust algorithms for automated spike detection. The findings and methodologies employed in this project can potentially enhance our understanding of epileptic activity and pave the way for improved patient care.
